I build products that make complex technology feel simple and meaningful. Lately, I'm energized by products that aim to make a difference in the world. In an era where AI integration seems ubiquitous, I believe in keeping the end user's experience simple to deliver real value – not everything needs to be a chatbot.

My approach comes from an unconventional path (as do most product managers) – from optimizing hardrock mining operations to developing AI platforms for federal agencies to launching consumer apps that help people build better relationships. Three core elements define how I approach product challenges: empathy, strategy, and delivery.

## My philosophy on empathy:

- Everyone brings their own perspective and biases – understanding these is crucial for builders, buyers, and end-users
- Internal research is as vital as external – knowing what energizes teams and what blocks them shapes better outcomes
- Good questions and observation beat micromanagement every time

Great products are built with great people. Empathy starts with understanding the full context of how products come to life. Through years of close collaboration with designers, engineers, and researchers, I've developed a deep appreciation for how different disciplines approach problems. When building Tally Health's biological testing platform, this meant spending time in the trenches with engineering and research teams to understand technical constraints, sitting with designers to grasp the nuances of the testing experience, and directly observing users interact with early prototypes. This foundation of shared understanding leads to better products and more cohesive teams.

## My philosophy on strategy:

- The best strategies can be distilled into one sentence
- Strategy should unite teams and provide a backbone for prioritization – temporary slowdowns are acceptable, permanent ones aren't
- Strategy cycles should match company maturity – six to eight weeks for startups, quarterly to yearly for established products

Strategy is about creating clarity that enables action. I approach it through the product strategy stack – understanding what must come before strategy (mission, vision, user needs, market context) and what follows (goals, roadmap, tactics, execution) ensures strategy serves its true purpose: accelerating teams rather than slowing them down. Having worked across startups, scale-ups, and enterprises, I've learned how strategy needs to flex based on the company stage. At Ready Platform, we operated in tight monthly strategy cycles as we found product-market fit and launched our early product. At Deloitte, we worked with longer semi-annual horizons for established products. The key is ensuring strategy unites teams and guides prioritization without becoming a barrier to progress.

## My philosophy on delivery:

- Shipping without learning is as problematic as not shipping at all – low quality can sometimes hinder learning
- Process should adapt to the team, not the other way around (with reasonable compromise)
- Quality and speed aren't opposites – they're partners in learning what matters

Delivery is where vision meets reality. I believe in "earned complexity" – the idea that features should solve proven needs and integrate seamlessly into users' existing lives and workflows. Whether it's Scrum or Kanban, the methodology should serve the team's needs. This means adapting processes to team dynamics while maintaining consistent shipping cycles. Whether working with a three-person startup team or a hundred-person federal product group, I focus on creating lightweight processes that enable teams to ship quality work and learn quickly from user behavior.

Over the years, I've seen these three elements at work independently and together. Empathy without strategy can lead to endless research and scattered efforts. Strategy without delivery often becomes nothing more than fancy words in a document. And delivery without empathy might ship quickly, but rarely ships the right thing. It's at the intersection of all three where the most impactful products emerge – where deep understanding guides clear direction, and clear direction enables meaningful execution. This is where I focus my energy: using technology as a lever for positive change, guided by empathy, focused by strategy, and realized through consistent delivery.

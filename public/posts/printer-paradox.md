Technology doesn't just naturally become easier to use over time. Sometimes it becomes more complex, often unnecessarily so. Just ask anyone trying to explain wireless printing to both their parents and their kids.

## The complexity trap

"Users are asking for more features!" One of the most common phrases heard in product meetings. And they are - users will always ask for more features. But here's the trick: users are better at describing their problems than prescribing solutions.

I've seen this pattern repeatedly in product development. Teams rush to build exactly what users ask for, rather than taking the time to understand the underlying needs. It's like adding wireless printing because users said printing was hard, when the real problem might be that they need an easier way to share documents.

What I've learned from countless user interviews – whether with federal employees at Deloitte or early adopters at Ready Platform – is that the art of product thinking lies in decoding what users are really telling us. When a user asks for a feature, they're usually pointing to a problem. Our job is to find the best solution, which often isn't what they initially requested.

## Solving for complexity at Ready and Tally Health

At Ready, I faced a unique challenge: how do you add novel features to an experience that users already understand? Dating apps have established patterns that users know well. Our users wanted more – more meaningful matches, more guidance, more ways to connect. But adding complexity to a familiar experience risks breaking what already works.

Through interviews with 50+ early users and analysis of our 60,000-person waitlist, we developed what I call "earned complexity." Every new feature had to prove it could integrate seamlessly into the core experience:

1. Launch with familiar matching capabilities
2. Track how users navigate between old and new features
3. Analyze where users get lost or drop off
4. Create direct user feedback loops
5. Only then expand features that enhance the core experience

At Tally Health, I encountered a different flavor of the same challenge. We were building an experience that combined at-home biological health testing with personalized insights. Users wanted detailed results and actionable lifestyle recommendations. But early research showed they struggled to navigate between the testing experience and the results dashboard.

This is where I learned that sometimes the best solution isn't adding to the backpack – it's reorganizing what's already inside. Through user feedback, we discovered that our initial organization of features was creating unnecessary complexity. We reimagined the navigation, focusing on the natural flow between testing and results. This reorganization led to a 20% increase in feature usage, not because we added more, but because users could better access what was already there.

## Key learnings and looking forward

What began as feature development challenges at Ready and Tally Health evolved into a broader product philosophy that I continue to explore. The most valuable insights often come from watching users interact with our platforms. The successful features aren't necessarily the most sophisticated – they're the ones that feel natural within the user's existing mental model.

This observation has shaped my approach to product development. Now, when faced with complexity challenges, I focus on three key questions:

1. Does this solve a proven user need? Beyond just user requests, we need to validate through both qualitative interviews and usage data whether a problem truly needs solving.

2. Can users discover it naturally? The best features become invisible – they fit so well into the user's workflow that no tutorial is needed. This is particularly crucial when adding novel features to familiar experiences, as we found at Ready.

3. Does it make the core experience better, not just bigger? Sometimes this means reorganizing existing features rather than adding new ones, as we discovered at Tally Health. A 20% increase in feature usage came not from adding complexity, but from making the existing experience more intuitive.

Like that printer meme suggests, complexity isn't inherently bad. The key is building complexity that serves real needs – and making it feel simple enough that neither our parents nor our kids need a tutorial. As products continue to evolve and AI capabilities expand, this challenge of balancing sophistication with simplicity becomes even more crucial.

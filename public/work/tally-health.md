## Overview

Led product research, design, and development for Tally Health's biological age testing platform, creating an integrated system that made complex longevity science accessible while driving recurring user engagement through a combination of testing, content, and e-commerce experiences.

## Company

Tally Health is a groundbreaking biotech company founded by Dr. David Sinclair, pioneering accessible biological age testing and personalized longevity insights. The company's vision is to make healthier aging accessible through a combination of at-home testing, scientific research, and actionable health recommendations. By blending cutting-edge longevity science with consumer-friendly technology, Tally Health aims to help people understand and improve their biological age.

## Challenge

Through research, we identified a few technical and user experience challenges to solve in our initial release.

   - Create an intuitive testing process that minimized errors while maintaining clinical validity
   - Keep users actively engaged during the one-month lab processing period and 3-6 month intervals between tests
   - Build a seamless experience connecting: E-commerce platform (Shopify) for test kit and supplement purchases, lab processing systems for result tracking, and content delivery for education and recommendations
   - Deliver test results while accounting for emotions of unexpected results to maintain trust in Tally's testing and research

## Approach

## 1. Easy onboarding and testing experience
- Designed step-by-step kit registration and testing flow
- Created clear visual instructions for sample collection
- Ensured progressive onboarding with limited information per page
- Implemented real-time validation to minimize errors
- Built API integration with lab systems for status tracking

## 2. Multi-layer engagement
- Developed "Pizza Tracker" style progress indicator showing lab processing stages
- Created lifestyle assessment quiz providing immediate value
- Built personalized action plans with multiple intensity levels
- Embedded easier to learn tips and tricks for quick implementation and adoption into lifestyle
- Implemented dedicated research section for deeper scientific content

- 20% increase in feature engagement after navigation redesign
- Successful integration with Shopify driving recurring revenue
- 85% retention metrics for subscription product

## Key Insights: Finding common ground in longevity goals

Building a health platform that could serve both technical experts and mainstream users revealed insights about engagement and accessibility:

## 1. Confirmed user overlap
Our initial hypothesis separated users into distinct groups: biohackers seeking deep technical data and mainstream users wanting simple insights. However, our research revealed a not-so surprising overlap: both groups shared a strong desire to learn. This insight helped us create a unified content strategy that allowed users to progressively explore deeper scientific content while maintaining an accessible entry point.

## 2. Simplify navigation
Through analytics analysis and user interviews, we quickly identified where users were dropping off or missing valuable features. This led to a focused redesign of our navigation system, with an emphasis on intuitive content discovery. By restructuring around user learning patterns, we saw a 20% increase in feature engagement, particularly in our research section.

## 3. Progressive discovery
The success of our platform hinged on helping users find the right information at the right time. We developed a content strategy that:
- Started with core test results and immediate actions
- Provided clear pathways to deeper scientific content
- Used behavioral data to surface relevant research
- Created a dedicated research section for users seeking depth

These insights fundamentally shaped our approach to product development, demonstrating that effective platforms don't just store information â€“ they guide users to the knowledge they need while supporting their growing expertise. Our thoughful change to the navigation confirmed users will embrace change that makes their lives easier.
